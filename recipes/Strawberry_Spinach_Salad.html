    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This strawberry spinach salad is a great way to get kids to eat spinach! Someone brought this salad to a potluck dinner, and I had to have the recipe. Since then, I've made it many times and I've been asked for the recipe every time I take it somewhere.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <strong>Dressing:</strong>

      <li> ½ cup white sugar</li> 
        
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>  
        
       <li>¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li> 
        
       <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li> 
        
       <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li> 
        
       <li>1 tablespoon minced onion</li> 
        
      <li> ¼ teaspoon paprika</li> 
        
       <li> ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        
       <strong>Salad:</strong> 
        
       <li>1 quart strawberries - cleaned, hulled and sliced</li> 
        
       <li>10 ounces fresh spinach - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces</li> 
        
       <li>¼ cup almonds, blanched and slivered</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
       <li><strong>Step </strong></li> 
        <p>
            In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.
    
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</p>
        
    </ol>
